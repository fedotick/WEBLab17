Repositories with solved tasks.

## Tasks

1. Given an object `{js:'test', jq: 'hello', css: 'world'}`. Get an array of its keys.

2. The table contains the salaries of the workshop employees for the current month. Find the employee number whose salary deviates the least from the average salary of all employees for the current month. Find the surnames of the two employees with the highest salaries.

3. Given a one-dimensional array of integers `A[1..n]`. Write a program that will rewrite into an array `B[1..n]` first in decreasing order all negative elements of array `A`, and then in increasing order all positive elements of array `A`. For example, for `A = (4, -8, 7, -6, 0, -7, 5)`, we get `B = (-6, -7, -8, 0, 4, 5, 7)`.

4. Create a web page containing 4 HTML buttons. When each button is clicked, an alert window should appear displaying the date and time relative to the current date and time. The first button "Now" should display the current date and time, the second button "Yesterday" should display the date and time 24 hours ago, the third button should display the date and time 10 years ago, and the fourth button should display the date and time a week from now.

5. Display on the screen the number of seconds remaining until the end of the day.

6. Output the name of the month for the entered date.

7. A string of characters is entered. A group of characters, separated on one or both sides by one or more spaces and not containing spaces inside itself, will be called a word. "Reverse" each word while preserving their order in the string.

8. Write a script that reads a phone number in the format `(555) 555-5555`. The script should use the `split` method of the `String` object to extract the country code (value in parentheses) and the phone number. Display the extracted data in different text fields.
